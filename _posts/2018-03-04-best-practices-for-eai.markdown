_If you don't care where you are going ,any road will take you there_

Useful software applications derive their value from collaoration between different systems.
System integration technologies help the systems to work together productively while overcoming many challenges.

Key challenges for a system integrator to address are:

1.  Establishing reliable communication between systems even when some of them might be momentarily unavailable.

2.  Ensuring that the system performs per business needs.
    * Determine the non functional system requirements in quantitative terms e.g.
    ** Avg. request rate(s)
    ** Peak request rate(s)
    ** Payload size(s)
    * Establish performance benchmarks to use 
    * Establish a realistic test setup 
    * Can the system can handle stress and failures gracefully

3.  Ensuring Monitorability
    * Be the first one to know when errors occur
    * Know what to do when something bad happens.

4.  Scaling up and down
    * Scale up the systems when demand is high
    * Scale down the systems to conserve resources when demand is low.

5.  Enabling Machine Learning - Ensure that the integration system can leverage AI.
